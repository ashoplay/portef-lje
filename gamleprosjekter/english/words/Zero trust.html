<ul>Zero trust</ul>
<p>Zero Trust is a cybersecurity framework that challenges the traditional notion of trust within network and data security. It operates on the principle that trust should never be assumed for any user or system, regardless of their location relative to an organization's network perimeter. Instead, Zero Trust mandates continuous authentication and validation of the identity and security posture of all users, devices, and applications seeking access to resources or data. This approach prioritizes security by limiting access rights, implementing stringent identity verification, segmenting networks, continuously monitoring for anomalies, encrypting data, and adopting a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture, all aimed at mitigating evolving cyber threats and reducing the risk of breaches in an increasingly complex IT landscape.</p>
