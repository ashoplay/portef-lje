<ul>Dark web</ul>
<p>The dark web, accessible through specialized networks like Tor or I2P, represents a concealed corner of the internet. It prioritizes user anonymity and privacy, achieved through sophisticated encryption and routing techniques that obscure online activities. In contrast to the visible web indexed by search engines, the dark web hosts a wide array of content, including both legitimate and illegal offerings. It is sought after by individuals seeking confidentiality for legitimate reasons, such as protecting sensitive communications, as well as those engaged in illicit activities.</p>
